-c Hi I'm a comment. I can go anywhere on a single line.

--start-config
-c The config section. Displayed below are all of the config options set to their defaults.

writable-relative-directory=tmp
-c Configure which relative directory to your project the Meow pid files should be written to.
-c If this directory is empty after Meow delete's its pid files then it will delete the directory as well.


auto-check-updates=true
-c When set to true, Meow will run a silent update check when Meow terminates. If an update is found, Meow will prompt you.


apple-tab-spawn-delay=0.5
-c Apple's osascript, as implemented, doesn't like running concurrently when multiple tabs are spawned in the background of the shell.
-c To solve this, a slight delay was added. If you find it too short or too long you can configure that here.
-c Keep in mind, making it too short will result in odd behavior.
-c Values are in seconds and the default value, 0.5, should be read as half a second.


linux-shell=bash
-c If you're on Linux you should tell Meow what shell you are using.


-c If you're happy with the above default values. You can delete the entire config section if desired but not recommended.
--end-config


--start-commands
-c The commands section. Here is where you provide Meow the processes you would like it to start.
-c Don't use "|" pipes in your commands. Meow will break.
-c Meow spawns processes in the background using the regular old shell "&". If your process can't be set in the background then it won't work.
-c This first section of commands belong to the Boss tab. The tab you are operating in when you execute Meow.

-c The process at the beginning will be put at the foreground of your tab.
sleep 1000
-c The processes after the first per tab runs in the background.
sleep 2000

--new-tab-expire
cd $HOME/my_project_two
sleep 3000
sleep 4000

--new-tab-endure

cd $HOME/my_project_three
sleep 5000
sleep 6000
