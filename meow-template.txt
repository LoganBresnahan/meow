# Hi I'm a comment. I must start on my own line.

--start-config
# The config section. Displayed below are all of the config options set to their defaults.

writable-relative-directory=tmp
# Configure which relative directory to your project the Meow pid files should be written to.
# If this directory is empty after Meow delete's its pid files then it will delete the directory as well.


auto-check-updates=true
# When set to true, Meow will run a silent update check when Meow terminates. If an update is found, Meow will prompt you.


apple-tab-spawn-delay=0.5
# Apple's osascript, as implemented, doesn't like running concurrently when multiple tabs are spawned in the background of the shell.
# To solve this, a slight delay was added. If you find it too short or too long you can configure that here.
# Keep in mind, making it too short will result in odd behavior.
# Values are in seconds and the default value, 0.5, should be read as half a second.


linux-shell=bash
# If you're on Linux you should tell Meow what shell you are using.


# If you're happy with the above default values. You can delete the entire config section if desired but not recommended.
--end-config


--start-commands
# The commands section. Here is where you provide Meow the processes you would like it to start.
# Meow spawns processes in the background using the regular old shell "&". If your process can't be set in the background then it won't work.
# This first section of commands belong to the Boss tab. The tab you are operating in when you execute Meow.

# The process at the beginning will be put at the foreground of your tab.
sleep 1000
# The processes after the first per tab runs in the background.
sleep 2000

--new-tab-expire

# Use "-cd" to tell Meow to change the working directory for a new tab.
-cd $HOME/my_project_two
sleep 3000
sleep 4000

--new-tab-endure

-cd $HOME/my_project_three
sleep 5000
sleep 6000

--end-commands
